This is a quick and dirty experimental console app that explores integration with the Gmail API.
I am using a Desktop App that I have registered on Google console and the sample client secret file shows some configuration boilerplate.

What has annoyed me for years already is that Gmail does not come with a sorting feature on its columns.
This is the main driver behind this little app: I want to sort unread emails by the number of emails received per sender.

The app still needs a lot of optimization because even just requesting 100 emails takes a lot of time, but it's a valuable proof of concept!
